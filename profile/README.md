### Why use PyUnify
- You open up a data set
- You have no idea what the columns mean
- You have no idea what is valuable, or what is missing
- You don't know which algorithms can you use effectively with your data
- You waste a tremendous amount of time trying to figure this out
- You pass it off to the next person who has to go through all of this again
- We want to break that productivity-destroying experience.
- We want to make the world a bit better of a place for our data community.
